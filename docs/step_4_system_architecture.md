# System Architecture Design

## Overview
The system architecture for the Inventory Management System is designed to be modular and scalable, leveraging modern web technologies to ensure efficient performance and maintainability.

## Main Components

### 1. Frontend
- **Framework**: React (TypeScript)
- **State Management**: MobX
- **Styling**: Ant Design (Antd)

### 2. API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `https://dev-0tf0hinghgjl39z.api.raw-labs.com/inventory`
- **Method**: GET
- **Purpose**: Fetch inventory data and update local state

### 3. User Interface
- **Components**: 
  - Dashboard with widgets
  - Product table with sortable columns
  - Edit modal for product management
- **Navigation**: Role switch toggle for admin/user

## Component Interactions

### Data Flow
- **API Data Fetching**: Data is fetched from the API and stored in MobX state.
- **State Updates**: Components subscribe to MobX state changes to update the UI in real-time.

### User Roles
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implemented at the component level to restrict access to certain features based on user role.

## Design Patterns and Best Practices

### Component-Based Architecture
- **Reusable Components**: Design UI components to be reusable across different parts of the application.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate logic, UI, and state management to enhance maintainability.

### Performance Optimization
- **Efficient State Updates**: Minimize re-renders by using MobX's reactive state management.
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for non-critical components to improve initial load time.

### Security Considerations
- **Role Validation**: Ensure role validation is performed on the client-side to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
